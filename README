A basic ps3 usb controller driver for 9front. There is no bluetooth support
so you have to plug in the controller to use it.

It binds to the keyboard and translates button presses to keys, the axes
are translated into discrete values that trigger above a threshold.

Keyboard bindings can be configured with the file $home/lib/ps3joy.cfg,
look in the source code for a sample config (it uses a default binding if no
config exist).

Very janky all in all and limited, it was an just excercise to play 
around with 9front usb support.
